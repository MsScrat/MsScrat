### Hi, I'm Miriam 👋🏼

  🤓 A student at Noroff, studying to be a front-end developer.  
  🌱 HTML, CSS, JS, GitHub, Figma design and much more.   
  🙌🏼 Further studies will be one year with UX or UI design.  

  🌟 On my free-time I love gaming, cooking and spending time with family.  
  🎮 My current favourite games are Fortnite, Red Dead 2 and The Witcher 3.  
  🐶 A fun fact about me is that I have a cute dog named Freia.
