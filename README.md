### Hi, I'm Miriam 👋🏼

  🤓 I’m a student at Noroff, studying to be a front-end developer.  
  🌱 This first year I have learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress and webdesign using Figma.  
  🙌🏼 My study plans are: two years Front-End and one year with UX/UI design.  

  🌟 On my free-time I love gaming, cooking and spending time with family.  
  🎮 My current favourite games are Assassins Creed (in general), Red Dead 2 and The Witcher 3.  
  🐶 A fun fact about me is that I have a cute dog named Freia.
